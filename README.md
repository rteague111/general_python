# Python Data Analysis & ML Practice

This repository contains Python-based projects focused on data analysis, lightweight SQL usage, and introductory machine learning concepts.

The primary goal of this repo is to demonstrate practical, hands-on Python work using realistic datasets and workflows rather than toy examples.

---

## Project Goals

- Practice Python for data analysis and automation
- Use SQL (primarily SQLite) as a lightweight data backend
- Explore data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization
- Gradually introduce machine learning concepts in a practical way
- Build a clean, well-documented portfolio of work

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- SQLite (local, file-based databases)
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (as projects progress)
- matplotlib / seaborn (as needed)

---

## Repository Structure


> Note: Databases, raw data, and generated outputs are intentionally excluded from version control.

---

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a Python virtual environment
3. Install required dependencies
4. Run scripts or open notebooks to explore the analyses

SQLite databases are created locally by the scripts as needed.

---

## Current Focus

- Warehouse / inventory-style data analysis
- Tracking incoming shipments and processing times
- Aggregation and trend analysis using SQL and pandas

Future work may include:
- Predicting processing times
- Basic classification and regression models
- Moving from SQLite to PostgreSQL or cloud databases for practice
